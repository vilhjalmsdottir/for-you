I fought invisible battles just to see you smile, but even so, I let you slip away. Fear stole my breath, and you slipped through my fingers.

I wanted to knock on your door, to go after you, but everything seems out of place. I let the silence fill the night, swallow the longing, and make it my refuge.

I just wanted your light by my side, to brighten the days when the darkness insists on staying.
